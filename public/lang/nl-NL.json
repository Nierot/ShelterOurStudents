Imrad came to Groningen with his friend Rasel from a small Asian country to pursue a technical degree at the University, as they both thought that a dutch degree would provide them with more opportunities than one from their home country.",
                    "A degree that will cost them at least 13600€/year, coming from a nation with an average salary of less than 200€ per month. Instead of being able to fully focus on this expensive investment, they are facing homelessnes, in a city they don’t know, in a country whose language they don’t speak and in a culture that is unfamiliar to them. A place which lies more than 7000 kilometers away from their home, with institutions and rules that are foreign to them, without having any friends or family here where they could seek shelter. Their reservation in their hotel will run out by the time of writing, Sunday the 05th, and Imran told me that they were not able to find anything else yet. He doesn’t know what to do anymore.",
                    "When I asked Imran where he sees the root of the problem, he made it very clear that it was irresponsible of the University to admit way more students than its city could sustain. Additionally, before coming here, it was not communicated to him at all by his school how dire this situation is and how difficult the search would be. They stated that they hope to find something next week, but even though both seemed like very polite, respectful and friendly persons this seems very unlikely given the circumstances."

We, Shelter Our Students, set up this platform because we predicted that many more students would arrive in the city than last year. Year after year, international students end up homeless in emergency housing in September as they are unable to find a room before the start of their studies. They must pay to stay in large, cheerless dorms, or otherwise stay at a hostel as an expensive short-term last resort. But the hotels and hostels have filled up, as has the emergency housing, and there are not enough couchsurfing hosts to house all 600 students who signed up on our platform. Students are drawn into the University but upon arrival are left to sleep on the streets. "

The University’s PR strategy, characterized by slogans as #happyinGroningen, is misleading at best and dangerous at worst. More importantly, the University sees students end up in these stressful circumstances every year and yet has not taken the steps necessary to prevent this situation from arising again. In 2018, student-led protests pressured the University to agree to four demands in order to improve the situation for students who were living in emergency tents and to speak out against the funding model that incentivizes the growth of universities.",

WOinActie has been protesting the financial model and underfinancing of the universities and shown us how the increasing numbers of students drive up the unpaid overwork of staff. The University must stop being run as a business according to the perverse, neoliberal profit incentives in order for the quality of life of students and teachers to improve. The Woonprotesten throughout the country this month show us that the system of housing that allows investors and slumlords (huisjesmelkers) free reign is not in the interest of buildings’ main aim: housing people. Housing is a fundamental human right, but housing prices sky-rocket and the right of residence is threatened by the landlord levy (verhuurderheffing) and vacant houses bought by foreign investors. In both cases, profits are valued above the quality of people’s lives and work. Rising tuition, housing prices and the student loan system (leenstelsel) make housing and education increasingly a privilege of the wealthy, rather than a right. These ever-deteriorating living conditions cannot be seen separately from the capitalist system of private property and the neoliberal drive towards privatization that exacerbates them. "
