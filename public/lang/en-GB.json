Shelter Our Students set up this platform because we predicted that many more students would arrive in the city than last year. Year after year, international students end up in emergency housing in September as they are unable to find a room before the start of their studies. They must pay to stay in large, cheerless dorms, or otherwise stay at a hostel as a short-term last resort. But the hotels and hostels have filled up, as has the emergency housing, and there are not enough couchsurfing hosts to house all 500 students who signed up on our platform. Students are drawn into the university but upon arrival are left to sleep on the streets. "

The university’s PR strategy, characterized by slogans as #happyinGroningen, is misleading at best and dangerous at worst. More importantly, the university sees students end up in these stressful circumstances every year yet has not taken the steps necessary to improve the situation. In 2018, student-led protests pressured the university to agree to four demands in order to improve the situation for students who were living in emergency tents and to speak out against the funding model that incentivizes the growth of universities.",

WoInActie has been protesting the financial model of the universities and shown us how the increasing numbers of students drive up the unpaid overwork of staff. The university must stop being run as a business according to the perverse, neoliberal profit incentives in order for the quality of life of students and teachers to improve. The Woonprotesten throughout the country this month show us that the system of housing that allows investors and slumlords (huisjesmelkers) free reign is not in the interest of buildings’ main aim: housing people. Housing prices sky-rocket and the right of residence is threatened by the landlord levy (verhuurderheffing) and vacant houses bought by foreign investors. In both cases, profits are valued above the quality of people’s lives and work. Rising tuition and housing prices make housing and education increasingly a privilege of the wealthy, rather than a right. These ever-deteriorating living conditions cannot be seen separately from the capitalist system of private property and the neoliberal drive towards privatization that exacerbates them."
